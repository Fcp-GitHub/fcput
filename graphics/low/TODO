Here are stored the files for the implementation of the lower "layer":
100% compatible interfaces to the lower-level APIs.

Helper functionalities that are closer to the original APIs (= depend
on intrinsic mechanisms of a specific API) have to be defined here.

These should be thin wrappers (= adding as little overhead as possible 
while improving ease of use and intuitiveness) of the original functionalities.
