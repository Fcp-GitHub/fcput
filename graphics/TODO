Make library interfaces as implementation/API-agnostic as possible.
This allows for different "server" implementations for the same "client" code.
In the future, the same code should be run entirely using Vulkan or DirectX instead
of OpenGL. Maybe a "two-layer" implementation should be done:
- The first layer would be an implementation of helper functions and classes
  for a particular API.
- The second and "higher" layer would be for the actual client code of more common use.
  This would probably be developed using the first layer too.

All the other libraries and programs should be helped by these helper functionalities.
