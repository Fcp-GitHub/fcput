Here are stored the files for the implementation of a high-level graphics library, 
possibly implemented using the low-level API ? This should be tested, it may make 
implementation easier as well as add complexity to the codebase. Furthermore (and 
most of all), it should not add performance overhead! 

The higher interface should be API-AGNOSTIC.
